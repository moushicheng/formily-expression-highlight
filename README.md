# formily-expression-highlight

## motive

formily expression like

```js
{
  title: "{{console.log('hello,world')}}";
}
```

beacuse expression is string type,so vsc can't support any code highlight.

## effect

use this plugin,we can get expression code highlight,vsc will match {{ content }},then treat content as js code.
